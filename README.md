# quiz-app
Android application that allows students to learn questions before certain test

## Description

This is an app I wrote with two friends that uses firebase database to allow students remotely download and take quizes to learn to exams.

It's a step foreward because to this moment question bases were passed as folders with .txt files.

We have written this application while learning android framework, and that's why it's not made with enterprise solutions.

However it's fully usable and you can download it from [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadowtesseract.politests&hl=en_US)

To this moment it has helped students from at least three univerities.
